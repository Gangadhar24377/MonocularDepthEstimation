# Depth Estimation

## Instructions

To successfully run the `detection.ipynb` notebook, follow these steps:

### 1. Dataset Folder

Ensure the `ryu_data` folder (dataset folder) is located in the same directory as the `detection.ipynb` file. This folder should contain all the necessary data for the depth estimation process.

### 2. Update File Paths

Open the `detection.ipynb` file in your Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Inside the notebook, locate the sections where file paths are specified.

Replace the existing paths with their corresponding paths on your local machine. Update the paths for the following files and directories:

- Replace `path/to/ryu_data` with the actual path to the `ryu_data` folder.
- Update any other file paths or directory paths as required based on the structure of your local dataset folder.

### 3. Save and Run

After making the necessary changes to the file paths, save the `detection.ipynb` file.
